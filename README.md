## üß† What is Artificial Intelligence (AI)?

*Artificial Intelligence (AI)* refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are designed to think, reason, learn, and make decisions. AI is a broad field that encompasses various technologies like computer vision, natural language processing (NLP), robotics, and machine learning.

> *Example:* A smart assistant like Google Assistant that understands your voice, gives weather updates, and controls home appliances is an AI system.

## üìà What is Machine Learning (ML)?

*Machine Learning (ML)* is a *subset of AI* focused on enabling machines to learn from data. Instead of being explicitly programmed with rules, ML systems detect patterns, learn from past experiences (data), and make predictions or decisions.

> *Example:* A credit card fraud detection system uses ML to learn what suspicious activity looks like and flag fraudulent transactions.

## üîç AI vs ML ‚Äì Key Differences

| Feature      | Artificial Intelligence (AI)               | Machine Learning (ML)                               |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
| *Scope*    | Broad: Includes all intelligent behavior   | Narrow: Only focuses on learning from data          |
| *Goal*     | Mimic human cognition                      | Learn and adapt from experience                     |
| *Includes* | Reasoning, perception, decision-making, ML | Algorithms that use statistical learning techniques |
| *Example*  | AI robot navigating an unknown environment | ML model predicting house prices based on features  |

## ü§ñ Types of Machine Learning Models

1. *Supervised Learning*

   * Learns from labeled data (input ‚Üí output)
   * Algorithms: Linear Regression, Decision Trees, SVM, KNN
   * *Example:* Spam detection in emails (spam vs. not spam)

2. *Unsupervised Learning*

   * Learns from unlabeled data by finding patterns or clusters
   * Algorithms: K-Means Clustering, PCA, DBSCAN
   * *Example:* Customer segmentation in marketing

3. *Semi-Supervised Learning*

   * Combines small labeled data with a large amount of unlabeled data
   * Useful when labeling is expensive
   * *Example:* Voice recognition systems that learn from both labeled and raw voice data

4. *Reinforcement Learning*

   * Learns by interacting with an environment and receiving feedback (rewards or penalties)
   * Algorithms: Q-Learning, Deep Q Networks (DQN)
   * *Example:* Game-playing AI like AlphaGo learning to win by playing millions of games

## üé® Generative Models (A Type of ML)

*Generative models* are a class of ML models that *learn to generate new data samples* similar to a training dataset. They‚Äôre often used in *image, video, text, and audio generation*.

### Popular Generative Models:

| *VAEs* (Variational Autoencoders)        | Encode and decode data to generate new samples                            | Handwriting synthesis                                         |
| *Transformers (LLMs)*                    | Predict and generate sequences of text                                    | ChatGPT generating answers, code, poems, stories              |
| *Diffusion Models*                       | Generate high-quality images via step-by-step denoising                   | DALL¬∑E, Midjourney ‚Äì image generation from text               |

> *Example:*
> ChatGPT is a generative model based on the Transformer architecture. It generates natural language responses by predicting the next word based on context, making it useful in chatbots, email writing, coding help, and more.
